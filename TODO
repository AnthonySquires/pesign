Stuff that needs to get done:

In no particular order, this stuff still needs to be done (or is in progress):

1) file i/o
 a) get an in-memory representation via mmap *done*
 b) render in-memory representation back to disk also via mmap
2) signatures
 a) read signature from stand-alone file
 b) write signature to stand-alone file *done*
 c) verify signature from stand-alone file
 d) read cert from file *done*
 e) create hash/digest of file *done*
 f) create new signature (aka "sign the hash")
 g) create cert table
 h) find cert table
 i) implant cert in table
3) test suite
